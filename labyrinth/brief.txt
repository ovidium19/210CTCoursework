Q:
Let's consider a labyrinth as a n Ã— m matrix, where the corridors are denoted by 1s situated in
consecutive positions on the same line or column. The rest of the elements are 0. Within the labyrinth,
a person is considered to be in position (i, j). Write a program that lists all exit routes which do not pass
the same place twice. Input: n, m, the rows of the matrix, the coordinates of the exit and the
coordinates of the person (row, column).Output: a sequence of row/column pairs representing the
person's successive position
