Implement the structure for an unweighted, undirected graph G, where nodes consist of positive
integers. Also, implement a function isPath(v, w), where v and w are vertices in the graph, to check if
there is a path between the two nodes. The path found will be printed to a text file as a sequence of
integer numbers (the node values). 13. Using the graph structure previously implemented, implement
a function isConnected(G) to check whether or not the graph is strongly connected. The output should
be simply 'yes' or 'noâ€˜.
