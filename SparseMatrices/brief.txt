BRIEF:

A sparse matrix is a matrix where the number of elements which are zero is bigger than the number of elements which are not zero. Find a way to store sparse matrices, and write the functions to add, subtract, and multiply pairs of such matrices. Do not use predefined functions for the operations on matrices in your programming language of choice.
