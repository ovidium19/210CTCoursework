Build a Binary Search Tree (BST) to hold English language words in its nodes. Use a paragraph of any
text in order to extract words and to determine their frequencies. Input: You should read the words
and frequencies from a file in a suitable format, such as .csv. The following tree operations should be
implemented: a) Listing (word, frequency) pairs for each of the tree nodes. b) Printing the tree in preorder.
C) Finding a word. Regardless whether found or not found your program should output the path
traversed in determining the answer, followed by yes if found or no, respectively.
